* Basic Description
One client will be created as the "white board" that anyone can draw on (generates QR code for others to connect to)
Other clients can sign on, and when they do, they will be assigned a random color and rectangular section of the whiteboard
They can draw on their phone/computer and anything they draw will be shown live on the whtie board


* Features
Basic functionality:
Create public canvas
Create ability to connect to canvas
Send signals from client to whiteboard

Client canvas can overlap causing them to interact with each other
Client can choose to reroll their section of the canvas (in case they don't want to draw over someone else's)
Clients are all assigned a different color at the same time that they are assigned their section of white board

Others:
Save the canvas (screenshot)
Erase?
Set stroke thickness
Choose a background color at the start
Transparent background
Choose a color pallete

* Possible Caveats
Live update or trasmit after every line?
Have to grab the viewport width/height from the phone, and use that size for the personal canvas
